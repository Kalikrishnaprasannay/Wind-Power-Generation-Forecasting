# Wind-Power-Generation-Forecasting

This project focuses on forecasting wind power generation using weather and turbine data collected from four different locations. The analysis includes data cleaning, merging, preprocessing, and visualization to prepare the dataset for machine learning modeling.


## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of 4 CSV files:
- `Location1.csv`
- `Location2.csv`
- `Location3.csv`
- `Location4.csv`

Each file contains wind and power generation data specific to a particular location.


## 🧠 Features

- Merges datasets from multiple locations
- Adds a location identifier column
- Cleans the dataset (duplicates, missing values)
- Encodes categorical features using one-hot encoding
- Scales numeric features
- Visualizes correlations and distributions

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kalikrishnaprasannay/Wind-Power-Generation-Forecasting.git
cd wind-power-forecasting
